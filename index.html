    <p><strong>I'm currently still occupied with
    a few personal projects of my
    own. There's more information
    about what I'm doing here. </strong></p>

    <p>I'm a student majoring in 
    Computer Science and I've had

    associates and some relatives.</p>

    <p>Anyhoo, I also write articles that goes out weekly (or bi-weekly) right
    here in this site. You can also read all about it in my newsletter, in case
    you don't want to bother with visiting this site every week. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>You'll get my best advice on the things I've learned so far for the Web
    and handy guides for some digital problem solving stuff.</strong></p>



    <p>You can unsubscribe anytime, but it would be very helpful to me in 
    improving as a person if you can tell me your reason. I won't send you 
    SPAM, and I  promise I will not send you a list of food I've eaten the past
    week. Of course, you can just read all my articles here if you hate emails.</p>
